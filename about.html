 <h1> Well…. What can I say? Life is complicated? No to be honest life is more than complicated.. I’m not going to lie, it’s not always a freebie.. You have those days where you just fall apart, some days where you just cry, some days where you’re happy. You have to learn to cope, and fight whatever happens. Realize that in life as you grow up things get harder.. You won’t always have a hand to hold and lead you in the right direction.. But the things you do are always your choice.. Nobody’s perfect, we all have our mistakes but that still doesn't change the consequences you will get so you learn..I’m a great kid, but I did lose myself somewhere down the road, I do have my mistakes, and times where I feel like I just have let everyone down.. But you know some things you do in your life will prevent it from happening to others..... Never feel alone, because trust me you’re not.. Keep your head held high, keep the bad thoughts out of your mind by talking about it..
I want everyone to realize that in life, times get so tough, and you have days where you just want to give up, BUT YOU CAN’T! There are so many here that actually care about you, it would crush us all. I mean think about this.. If you hit one spot on your wrist while cutting.. You could die… I didn't think of that.. But that’s why I am here to tell you this. I am sorry for what I did, and I am here to promise that things are going to change with me, I am going to overcome this depression, and never look back to my past other than to help someone. I’m never going to let any of you guys harm yourselves, or feel alone.. I promise that if you fight that battle that the other battles you’ll have to fight will be so easy you won’t even notice you fought another battle</h1>
