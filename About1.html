 <h1> Well… What can I say? Life is complicated? No to be honest life is more than complicated.. I’m not going to lie, it’s not always a freebie.. You have those days where you just fall apart, some days where you just cry, some days where you’re happy. You have to learn to cope, and fight whatever happens. Realize that in life as you grow up things get harder.. You won’t always have a hand to hold and lead you in the right direction.. But the things you do are always your choice.. Nobody’s perfect, we all have our mistakes but that still doesn't change the consequences you will get so you learn..I’m a great kid, but I did lose myself somewhere down the road, I do have my mistakes, and times where I feel like I just have let everyone down.. But you know some things you do in your life will prevent it from happening to others.....</h1>
